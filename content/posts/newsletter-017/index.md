Welcome to the 17th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea has a Discord!][wor-discord]

![New Way of Rhea assets](way-of-rhea.gif)
_Updated visuals for interactive items._

[Way of Rhea][wor-website] is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world
where you can only interact with objects that match your current color. The game
is being developed in a custom built Rust game engine and hot swappable
scripting language.

This month's updates:

- More progress has been made on the hub world! The game is no longer fully
  linear.
- All interactive elements are getting a visual update, pictured above.
- The devs have created [a Discord server][wor-discord] where you can hang out,
  stay up to date on the latest developments, and if you're interested, chat
  about the implementation (see the `#tech` channel.)

### [15-minute Santa][15m-santa]

![15-minute Santa](santa.png)

In [15-minute Santa][15m-santa], you deliver presents around a city, occasionally stopping at a restaurant to refuel -- biking uphill in the snow isn't easy! The game uses real data from OpenStreetMap and local GIS sources to know where shops, single-family homes, and apartments are located. In places where zoning rules keep people separated from food, Santa will have a hard time.

15-minute Santa was created by the [A/B Street](abstreet) team as an experiment to see how quickly we could build a simple arcade game that gets people thinking about how their city is designed. [The code](santa-code) doesn't make use of an entity-component system or an existing engine, and animation and particle effects don't use a custom shader. The game runs natively on Linux, Mac, and Windows, and on web browsers. There are instructions for modding the game and adding your own city!

A/B Street updates will return next month. In the meantime, please comment on the [2021 roadmap](abstreet-roadmap).
